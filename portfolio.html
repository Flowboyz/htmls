        <p class="rod">Introduction 
            Wireless networks are one of the relatively new technologies brought to our lives by the internet technologies. With the widespread use of internet, we are able to conduct our business processes online and without being tied down by cables and wires. Wireless technologies offer convenient solutions to our needs. They are practical and fast, easy to use, facilitate our business processes and mobilize our businesses. Moreover they set us free of the clutter caused by wires and cables.
            
            A wireless network is a set of two or more devices connected with each other via radio waves within a limited space range. The devices in a wireless network have the freedom to be in motion, but be in connection with the network and share data with other devices in the network. One of the most crucial points is that their installation cost is very cheap and fast than the wire networks.
            Wireless networks are widely used and it is quite easy to set them up. They use IEEE 802.11 standards. A wireless router is the most important device in a wireless network that connects the users with the Internet.
            
            Although wireless networks offer great flexibility, on the downside, wireless networks are much more vulnerable to attacks and intruders commonly known as wireless network attacks, penetration and intrusion acts that target wireless networks pose serious threats. 
            
            A hacker can sniff the network packets without having to be in the same building where the network is located. As wireless networks communicate through radio waves, a hacker can easily sniff the network from a nearby location. Most attackers use network sniffing to find the SSID and hack a wireless network. When our wireless cards are converted in sniffing modes, they are called monitor mode
            
            Wireless network attacks aim to capture the information sent across the network and/or intrude with the traffic of information.
